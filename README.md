# NKN-special-nft-collection
Since, we all know that NKN is a new kind of peer to peer network connectivity protocol and ecosystem powered by a novel public blobkchain. NKN has the largest number of nodes in  any blockchain network.
Here I have created some cards refering to the mission of NKN and NKN's community.
Each card is unique from each other and can be used to refer to either the mission, community, developer or partners of NKN.

Hope you love this art collection..!
